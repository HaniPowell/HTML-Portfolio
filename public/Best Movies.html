<h1>The Best Movies According to Hani</h1>
<h2>Hani's 5-star films.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>Two robots falling in love yet it feels more human than 90% of human romances I have seen.</p>

<h3>Memories of Murder</h2>
<p>A detective movie less about the case than the absolute, irresolvable psychological agony of obsession and failure.</p>

<h3>Monster</h3>
<p>What at first appears to be a simple story about a parent’s concern for their child’s safety gradually becomes something much richer and poignant. A blistering reminder that we often never fully know what another person is dealing with, especially a child.</p>
